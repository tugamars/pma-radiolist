# pma-radiolist
FiveM Script

This script only works if you run pma-voice as your VOIP system. You can find it here: https://github.com/AvarianKnight/pma-voice

The script adds a list on the top-right corner of the screen with all the IDs that are in your frequency. If someone is talking their ID will light in yellow.
There's also a possibility to add identifiers to this, the code is commented but you can integrate your framework if you know what you are doing.
